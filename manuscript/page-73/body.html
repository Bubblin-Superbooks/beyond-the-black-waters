It seemed less impossible to Io than it is to most people to <em>rejoice always</em>, for her trustful, restful spirit had found the secret of peace.</p><p>Mrs. Coldstream had also a perpetual source of pleasure in giving pleasure, of comfort in comforting others.

Thus Io rarely lacked something to make her happy, and she was constantly adding to the happiness of others. )</p></div> </div>
